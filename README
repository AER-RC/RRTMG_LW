This directory contains the source code and sample makefile necessary to run
RRTMG_LW version 3.0, a correlated k-distribution longwave radiative transfer 
model developed at AER, Inc for application to GCMs.  This version of RRTMG_LW 
has been modified from the standard RRTM_LW distributed by AER to enhance its 
performance for use within general circulation models.  Two modes of operation 
are possible.  RRTMG_LW can be run in stand-alone mode using the input files 
and source modules described below, or it can be attached to an atmospheric 
general circulation model. 

The version of RRTMG_LW provided here has been modified from the standard 
RRTM_LW to enhance performance with little effect on the accuracy.  The total 
number of g-points used have been reduced from 256 to 140. Fluxes are accurate
to within 0.5 W/m2 and cooling rate within 0.1 K/day relative to the standard
RRTM_LW, which is itself accurate to within 1 W/m2 of the data-validated 
line-by-line radiative transfer model, LBLRTM.

The following files (in /src directory) must be used to run RRTMG_LW in 
stand-alone mode:

   rrtmg_init.f          : RRTM initialization routine; reduces g-points to 140
   rrtmg_k_g.f           : Main absorption coefficient block data file
   rrtmg_cldprop.f       : Cloud optical properties
   rrtmg_rtrn.f          : Calculates clear and cloudy radiative transfer 
                           using random cloud overlap

implement RRTMG_LW to a GCM (changes to the main routine may be necessary for 
complete implementation in a specific GCM):
