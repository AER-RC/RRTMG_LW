 RECORD 1.1
 
      CXID:  80 characters of user identification  (80A1)
 
            CXID(1) is the flag which determines program initialization and termination.  
                    The actual input data stream for RRTM commences with the record 
                    containing a '$' in CXID(1).  Any records that are read prior to a 
                    record containing a '$' in CXID(1) are ignored.

         IREFLECT = 0 for Lambertian reflection at surface, i.e. reflected radiance 
			is equal at all angles (default)
                  = 1 for specular reflection at surface, i.e. reflected radiance at angle
			is equal to downward surface radiance at same angle multiplied by
			the reflectance (option not available in RRTMG_LW)
                  (Note:  for each band, surface reflectance = 1 - surface emissivity) 

         SEMISS   the surface emissivity for each band (see Table I).  All values must be 
                  greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.  If IEMIS = 1, only
                  SEMISS(1) is considered.  If IEMIS = 2 and no surface emissivity value 
                  is given for SEMISS(IB), a value of 1.0 is used for band IB.

                       For IATM = 1 (Record 1.2) and IBMAX = 0 (Record 3.1), the layer 
                       numbers can be determined by running RRTM for the cloudless case
                       and examining the TAPE6 output from this run.

   (if IAOD = 1)
            AOD        aerosol optical depth at the mid-point of each of the 16 spectral bands
 
 REPEAT RECORD A2.1.1 for the remaining layers containing this aerosol type. There should be NLAY
                       records A2.1.1 	



 REPEAT RECORDS A2.1 through A2.1.1 for the remaining aerosol types.  There should be NAER
                       sets (A2.1 through A2.1.1) of records.
