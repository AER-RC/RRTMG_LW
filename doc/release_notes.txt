RRTMG_LW Release Notes

NOTE: ** CVS rtags can't accept "." in strings, substitute "_"


August 29, 2008:

        Release_4_6

        Revised cloud property input to require in-cloud averaged cloud optical
        depth or in-cloud averaged cloud ice and liquid water paths in both the
        single-column and gcm versions of the code. In earlier versions of the gcm
        code, input grid-averaged cloud properties were scaled by the cloud fraction
        internally to generate in-cloud averaged properties.  This change requires 
        that this scaling be performed during the interfacing if necessary.  The
        minor structural modifications to the code have no effect on the results,
        though a minor change to the factor used to convert flux to heating rate
        will have a negligible effect on the heating rates. 

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in August 2008.

        - Added requirement that cloud properties be input as in-cloud averages
          rather than grid-averaged values in GCM code.
        - Renamed rrtmg_lw.f90 to rrtmg_lw_rad.f90 and renamed rrtmg_lw.nomcica.f90
          to rrtmg_lw_rad.nomcica.f90 for consistency between file names and
          module names. 
        - Replaced several 'where' statements with traditional loops in module
          mcica_subcol_gen_lw to improve computational performance on some systems.
        - Moved subroutine lwcldpr, which contains cloud absorption coefficient
          data, from module rrtmg_lw_cldprop.f90 to rrtmg_lw_init.f90.
        - Removed unnecessary use association of module mcica_subcol_gen_lw
          from rrtmg_lw_rad.nomcica.f90. 
        - Corrected arrays wavenum1 and wavenum2 in rrtmg_lw_init.f90 to change 
          the boundary between spectral band 14 and 15 from 2390 to 2380 cm-1. 
          These arrays are not used in the calculation, and the functional array
          delwave containing the band intervals was correct, so this change has
          no effect on results.
        - Revised definition and naming of integer and real kind type parameters. 
        - Changed setting of flag for selecting random number generator (irng) for
          McICA to make it a required input variable. Available options are kissvec 
          or Mersenne Twister. 
        - Increased precision of heatfac by changing it from a hard-wired value to 
          a calculated value and changed code to require input of specific heat of 
          dry air into init module (rrtmg_lw_init.f90) for heatfac calculation.   
        - Oxygen volume mixing ratio was changed from a hard-wired parameter to
          a required input array. 


April 24, 2008:

        Release_4_5

        Added capability to treat longwave aerosol absorption and added use of 
        input file IN_AER_RRTM to read in aerosol optical depths following the
        application of this file in RRTMG_SW.  Aerosol scattering is not presently 
        available in the longwave, so the required input is limited to the aerosol 
        optical depth by layer at the mid-point of each of the 16 spectral bands. 

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in April 2008.


September 7, 2007:

        Release_4_4

        Modified use of ice particle size variables rei/reicmc to utilize separate 
        variable names (dge/dgesmc) when units of generalized effective size are 
        required for iceflag=3 option. This allowed use of ice particle size in
        units of effective radius to parameterize cloud absorptivity using a basic
        approach when ice particle sizes are larger than the permitted range for
        the iceflag=3 option. Results may be minimally affected when ice particle
        sizes exceed 90 microns and iceflag=3 option is used. Also modified several
        local arrays in top-level subroutine module to accomodate an extra model 
        layer if this feature is utilized. 

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in September 2007.


August 28, 2007:

        Release_4_3

        Minor changes to makefile for AIX.  Corrected use of variables icld
        and nlay in top level source files for the subroutine version of code and
        for the McICA sub-column generator. There was no impact on results from
        these changes in the column version of the model. 

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in August 2007.


August 22, 2007:

        Release_4_1

        Made structural changes to modify code to use assumed-shape arrays
        rather than explicit-shape arrays throughout the model.  There was 
        no impact on results from these changes. 

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in August 2007.

        - Converted explicit-shape arrays to assumed-shape arrays.
        - Modified top level subroutine to a module and converted most of the
          other subroutines to modules.
        - Modified makefiles to clean up handling of compiled modules.
        - Added new makefile for AIX platforms.
        - Changed the name of the exponential lookup table arrays for 
          consistency with RRTMG_SW.
        - Added build directory for makefiles and doc directory for
          documentation to main model directory for consistency with other
          AER RT model archives.


April 27, 2007:

        Release_4_0_2

        Made kind type suffix changes.

        Not publicly released. Released to Yu-Tau Hou/NCEP on 30 April 2007.


        - Added several missing kind type suffixes to real constants in a few 
          source modules.
        - Made minor changes to README file.  


April 26, 2007:

        Release_4_0_1

        Minor bug fix and other minor changes.

        Not publicly released. 

        - Fixed dimensions of arrays abscoice and abscoliq from nbands to ngpt
          in source module rrtmg_lw_cldprmc.f90.  This did not affect results in
          most situations, but caused a fault in some cases on some compilers. 


April 17, 2007:

        Release_4_0

        Major source code format revisions and addition of McICA capability. 

        Not publicly released. Released to Robert Pincus/NOAA on 18 April 2007.

        - Reformatted entire model to utilize more FORTRAN90 coding features.
          All COMMON blocks have been removed.  Arrays are declared and dimensioned
          in modules, and array passing is done through subroutine calls.
          Excluded from the reformatting are files rrtatm.f, extra.f, and util_*.f,
          which are shared with and retain the formatting of RRTM_LW. 
        - Code package can be used as a stand-alone column model or as a callable
          subroutine (such as in a GCM).
        - McICA capability has been added for stochastic representation of sub-grid
          cloud variability such as cloud fraction and cloud overlap.
        - Sub-column generator for McICA is called from within main source module
          in column mode, but it must be called prior to RRTMG_LW in GCM mode.
        - Installed two options for the random number generator required for
          McICA (selected by changing the hard-wired flag irnd).
        - Modified code to accept either cloud physical properties or cloud optical
          properties when using McICA. 
        - Created makefiles consistent with RRTMG_SW for SGI, SUN, LINUX (pgi) and
          OS_X (g95) platforms.
       

August 26, 2005:

        Release_3_2_1

        Added several minor code changes that do not affect results.

        Not publicly released at this time.
        This version was utilized to test McICA in RRTMG_LW.

        - Converted several trace gases from scalars to arrays in rrtmg_lw_140.f
        - Corrected use of index IBND in rrtmg_lw_rtrn.f and rrtmg_lw_rtrnmr.f

July 28, 2005:

        Release_3_2

        Updating code to maintain consistency with RRTM_LW.
        Not publicly released at this time.

        - Fixed minor bugs in taumol and setcoef as reported by NCEP
        - Added WV continuum coefficients inadvertantly left out of k_gB15.f in the original
          RRTM_LW_v3.0 release
        - Updated rrtatm.f to be compatible with CVS revision 9.3 lblrtm.f
        - Fixed bug in the digits of PI in rrtmg_lw.f
        - Modified cldprop for updated ice properties
                * Updated the cldprop spheres to use latest streamer version 3.0.
                * Remade Fu properties on finer grid.
        - Added patent statement to all modules
        - Changed number of digits printed out in net flux in rrtmg_lw.f
        - Updated revision number format to be consistent with RRTM_SW/LBLRTM

April 22, 2004:
	
	Release_3_0_1 

        Not publicly released at this time. 

        - Source file names were changed for consistency to use the prefix rrtmg_lw. 
          The README file and makefile were also updated.

October 16, 2003:

	Release_3_0 

	RRTMG_LW is now being officially archived in CVS.  This code evolved from the standard 
        RRTM_LW release.  It includes modifications to enhance performance such as a reduced 
        g-point	set, and it is intended for application to GCMs.  Both a column version and a 
        subroutine version of this code are archived.

        This version was distributed to Kerry Emanuel (MIT) for use in the MIT radiative-convective 
        single column model.
        
        - Initial release version.  This version includes modifications to implement a spectrally 
               varying diffusivity angle based on the column precipitable water amount.
